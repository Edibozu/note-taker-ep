# Note Taker

## Description

This application provides the user with an online note taker. They are able to give their notes a title and type the rest of the message below. Then press "save" on the right hand side, and it will save the nore on the lefe-hand side of the screen. Previously saved notes will appear with only their title showing as a preview, and when no longer needed, the user can easily discard any unecessary note with the "delete" button.

 ## Installation

The Note Taker is deployed using [Heroku](https://ep-note-taker.herokuapp.com/), with the files used to create it within the [Github](https://github.com/Edibozu/note-taker-ep) repo, and can be easily cloned.
